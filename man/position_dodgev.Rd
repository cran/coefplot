\description{
  Vertical dodging internal
}
\details{
  A hacky adaptation of ggplot's position_dodge function to
  be used for vertical collisions.  No warranties on this
  working except that it looks good for now.

  No changes were necessary but this is a new geom with a v
  on the end
