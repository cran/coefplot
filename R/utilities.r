## @modelFactorVars: (character vector) names of variables that are factors
## @modelModel: (model.matrix) the model.matrix from the model, I would like this to be changed to accept a smaller set of the model.matrix so there is less data being passed arounf
## @modelCoefs: (character vector) the coefficient names that will be matched and shortened
## @shorten:  (logical or character vector) if true all variables will be shortened, if false, none will be (to save computation), if a character vector, only the ones listed will be shortened, the other will remain (this may get VERY complicated
## @factors: (character vector) a list of vectors to work with if we are only interested in a few
## @only: (logical) if factors restricts what we are looking at then decide if we want just that variable or the stuff it interacts with too
## have to finish dealing with only showing some factors while also shortening some, all or none
##      should be done! Yay!
